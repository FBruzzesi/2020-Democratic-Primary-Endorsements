Exploratory Data Analysis of 2020 Dem Primary Endorsements


This analysis is based on the Kaggle dataset https://www.kaggle.com/fmejia21/2020-democratic-primary-endorsements.

The main goal is to use plotly to create interactive plots, which are not rendering in a GitHub repository.

Therefore I am not displaying any graph at all, but you can use the code to create them for yourself, or check my work in the Kaggle kernel here: https://www.kaggle.com/lukeimurfather/2020-democratic-eda

Any feedback is more than welcomed, especially since I don't have any domain knowledge.
