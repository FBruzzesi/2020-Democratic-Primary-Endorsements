## Data Description
Context
Party elites use endorsements to influence not only voters but also each other, hoping to get other powerful party members to rally behind the candidate they think would be most acceptable. The pace of endorsements — whether leaders coalesce early around a single candidate or are backing a variety of candidates — can indicate how drawn out the primary season will be. A lack of a consensus can mean that party leaders’ first-choice candidate may have more trouble securing the nomination.
